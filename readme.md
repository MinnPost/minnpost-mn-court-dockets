# Minnesota Court Dockets Scraper

A simple web interface and wikiscraper for grabbing court dockets from: http://www.mnd.uscourts.gov/CourtCalendars.shtml

WikiScraper is here: https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/minnesota_us_district_courts/

# Notes:
wikiscraper.py is just a local copy of the code on WikiScraper so we don't lose it. This means it may not always be completely up to date in our repository, but I'll try to remember to keep them the same.

# Still need to do:
- Figure out a way to get context for these cases (hopefully..)

# Pie in the sky:
- Control of SQL statements (, court, date, etc.)
- Twitter/email when updates are found
- Run the scraper more than once a day (not possible with WikiScraper, run our own?)
